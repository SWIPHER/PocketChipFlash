  <h1><a href=3D"https://www.jfpossibilities.com/">JF Possibilities'</a> mi=
rror=20
  of CHIP ".deb" repositories.</h1>
 =20
  <p>This is a mirror NTC's Debian package archives, or at least the ones
  that I was aware of. I have mirrors for (you can browse them):</p>
    =20
  <menu>
    <li><a href=3D"http://chip.jfpossibilities.com/chip/debian/repo">CHIP</=
a></li>
    <li><a href=3D"http://chip.jfpossibilities.com/chip/debian/pocketchip">=
PocketCHIP specific additions</a></li>
  </menu>
  =20
   <p><b>FYI:</b> The PocketCHIP uses both the CHIP and PocketCHIP
   repositories listed above. The PocketCHIP specific software is in its ow=
n
   repository.</p>
  =20
   <p>To use these repositories all you need to do is update the applicable
   lines in your "/etc/apt/sources.list" files with my domain name.
   Example:</p>
  =20
   <h3>Original:</h3>
   <pre style=3D"border: 1px solid black; margin-left: 2em; padding: 2px;">=
deb http://<font color=3D"red">opensource.nextthing.co</font>/chip/debian/r=
epo jessie main
deb http://<font color=3D"red">opensource.nextthing.co</font>/chip/debian/p=
ocketchip jessie main
</pre>
  =20
   <h3>Change it to:</h3>
<pre style=3D"border: 1px solid black; margin-left: 2em; padding: 2px;">deb=
 http://<font color=3D"green">chip.jfpossibilities.com</font>/chip/debian/r=
epo jessie main
deb http://<font color=3D"green">chip.jfpossibilities.com</font>/chip/debia=
n/pocketchip jessie main
</pre>
  =20
   <p>I made sure to use the same paths for file locations to make it easie=
r
   on lesser experienced users. <b>Remember</b> the "pocketchip" line above
   will only be on PocketCHIP installs.</p>
  =20
   <p>You will also want to update the applicable
   lines in your "/etc/apt/preferences" files with my domain name.
   Example:</p>
  =20
   <h3>Original:</h3>
   <pre style=3D"border: 1px solid black; margin-left: 2em; padding: 2px;">=
Package: *
Pin: origin <font color=3D"red">opensource.nextthing.co</font>
Pin-Priority: 1050</pre>
  =20
   <h3>Change it to:</h3>
<pre style=3D"border: 1px solid black; margin-left: 2em; padding: 2px;">Pac=

   <p>There were two copies in my file. You just need one corrected copy.
   I left one copy of the original NTC section and altered the first with
   my repo domain name. If an "apt-get upgrade" breaks Pico-8 this change
   will fix it, after another "upgrade".</p>
  =20
   <p>Unfortunately NTC did not allow browsing of their repository servers
   so it was up to me to <i>guess</i> what was available for mirroring. I
   used Debian's <a href=3D"https://packages.debian.org/stretch/apt-mirror"=
>"apt-mirror"</a> to
   mirror the repositories listed on my devices. This clones a repository b=
y
   reading the package and release files pointed to by apt source=20
   definitions. This means that I can be missing stuff that
   might otherwise have been available on their server (old packages, repos
   not used by my devices, ...). It also means that the signing remained
   intact. So you can be cryptographically ensured that neither I nor anyon=
e
   else has tampered with this mirror. It also means you won't need to
   install a new key on your CHIP. :-)</p>
  =20
   <p><b>NOTE:</b> I refreshed my archive shortly before the NTC
   repository fell off the iNet. Since it had been a few months
   since NTC had been operating I'm reasonbly sure these are the
   "<i>Latest and Greatest</i>".</p>
  =20
   <hr>

   <h2>Trouble shooting</h2>
  =20
   <h3><u>Repository key propblems</u></h3>
  =20
   <p>I've had at least one person tell me that "apt-get" is telling them i=
t
   doesn't recognize the key that my copies of the NTC repository are signe=
d
   with (key ID 0483025E2847CC20). Since these are exact mirrors of the NTC
   stuff they are signed with the NTC private key, which I don't have. This
   means the signatures guarantee that the packages on here have not been
   tampered with by myself or anyone else. So its important to fix the key =
if
   its broken.</p>
  =20
   <p>If you don't have network access (WiFi, USB, ...) and you haven't <a =
href=3D"https://www.jfpossibilities.com/showcase/pocket-watch-pocketchip/">=
added an RTC</a> your time and date could be way off. Please check / set
   your time (see "man date") and try "apt-get" again. If that doesn't fix
   it then move on to the next paragraph.</p>
  =20
   <p>For any who still have problems with an apt-get warning you can
   download the NTC public key from here: <a href=3D"http://chip.jfpossibil=
ities.com/chip/debian/NTC.pub">NTC.pub</a>. Copy
   it to your CHIP and you can import it using the "apt-key" command. Like=
=20
   so:</p>
  =20
<pre style=3D"border: 1px solid black; margin-left: 2em; padding: 2px;">sud=
o apt-key add - &lt; NTC.pub
</pre>

    <p>Run that command from the directory where you put the file. Or you'l=
l
    need to change the file name in the command.</p>

   <h3><u>Debian archive problems</u></h3>
  =20
   <p>Debian has <i>archived</i> v8 (Jessie). And as of Feb 2023 they have
   also <i>archived</i> the "security updates". CHIP's OS is based on Debia=
n
   8. When they "archive" a release they pull it from the servers it was
   originally on and move it to <a href=3D"http://archive.debian.org/">arch=
ive.debian.org</a>. So far they
   have been good about maintaining the archive. You can find some really
   old stuff there. So I don't fear it will go away any time soon.</p>
  =20
   <p>If your getting errors about missing "...Release..." files it would b=
e
   caused by the <i>archiving</i> I mentioned. You'll want to adjust your=
=20
   "/etc/apt/sources.list" to something like:</p>

<pre style=3D"border: 1px solid black; margin-left: 2em; padding: 2px;">deb=
 http://archive.debian.org/debian/ jessie main contrib non-free
deb-src http://archive.debian.org/debian/ jessie main contrib non-free
deb http://archive.debian.org/debian-security jessie/updates main contrib n=
on-free
deb-src http://archive.debian.org/debian-security jessie/updates main contr=
ib non-free
deb http://archive.debian.org/debian jessie-backports main contrib non-free
deb-src http://archive.debian.org/debian jessie-backports main contrib non-=
free
deb http://chip.jfpossibilities.com/chip/debian/repo jessie main
deb http://chip.jfpossibilities.com/chip/debian/pocketchip jessie main
</pre>

   <p>Related to this, and the simpler scenario, some of the repos in use
   have an expired "InRelease" file. You'll get a messag like:</p>
  =20
   <p style=3D"border: 1px solid black; margin-left: 2em; padding: 2px;">
   Release file for .../InRelease is expired ...
   </p>
  =20
   <p>This can be fixed by adding this to the end of your
   "/etc/apt/apt.conf" file (if it doesn't exist create it):</p>

<pre style=3D"border: 1px solid black; margin-left: 2em; padding: 2px;">Acq=
uire::Check-Valid-Until "0";
</pre>
  =20
   <p>Another problem that has arisen recently is that the signing keys for
   Debian's repository have expired. This technically can't be
   <i>fixed</i>... well at least not without a time machine. This doesn't
   seem to cause a problem other than the annoying message that the
   repositories can't be authenticated, followed by the typical "<i>are you
   sure</i>" prompt.</p>
  =20
   <p>If you don't want to be bothered to answer "y" to those prompts you
   can add this line to your "/etc/apt/apt.conf" file:</p>
=20
<pre style=3D"border: 1px solid black; margin-left: 2em; padding: 2px;">APT=
::Get::AllowUnauthenticated "true";
</pre>

   <p>Be aware that this basically turns off all repository authentication.
   But this is the environment we live in. :-(</p>
